\section{Interaction Design - Paulo}
Interaction design is the process of understanding and satisfying needs and desires of a user or group that will use a product (goal-oriented design). In the design process, interaction sessions are held with the user, to get feedback on an early stage in the development process, or actively assist in the design process (Participatory Design).
When creating a goal-oriented design for a certain user or a target group, goals are set to understand and clarify the needs of the user or target group (Usability Goals). These goals will also give a basis for testing the final product, to validate if the user or group goals have been fulfilled.
\p
A web interface and a physical interface were developed. A participatory design method for the physical interface and a prototype of the web interface was developed, with focus on the user needs.
\p
This report will describe the design process in the development of the Energy Hub prototype as an academic project. The experience gained in the development of a prototype, meetings with the users and the use of different methods to design the interfaces will be described. A short description of the Energy Hub project will give an overall understanding and expected achievements.

\section{Problem Statement - Theis}
The PRO3 project is divided into sub projects that each team is working on. Energy hub is our project, the problem statement for the device is as follows (taken from the teachers wiki).
\begin{itemize}
	\item\textit{The system controller monitors all connected devices.}
	\item\textit{A connected device can either consume or produce power.}
	\item\textit{All devices must have a standardized interface, both HW/SW/Mech.}
	\item\textit{The controller must decide what happens with energy flows to and from all connected devices, in an optimum manner.}
	\item\textit{The hub must be able to recognize all connected devices.}
\end{itemize}
A new request was to make interaction with the hub through a web page, as well on the energy hub. The user interface for this purpose is to be developed with the methods provided in the EIDE1 course.

\section{Task Description - Theis}
The hub is the central part of the overall system, all the modules are connected to this unit. The hub has to react when different events occurs in the overall system. This could be when a device starts producing energy, then the hub has to find out what to do with the extra energy. For example a: consumer module starts using energy, or starts consuming more energy in a short period. 
\p
Our task is to develop a switch that controls all the modules and react on the above events. Due to the fact, that all modules are connected to the hub, then the interaction in this system is machine to machine communication. The human to machine interaction in the system is only taking place on the energy hub and on the  created energy web interface. The hub interaction is only for the owner to use, while the web site is for everyone to use, this gives some additional requirements for the user interface. On the web site it is possible to see the status of the hub, the modules and how much energy is being produced and consumed in the system.

\section{Stakeholder Analysis - Paulo}

Stakeholder Analysis is an important tool for developers, as the different involvement of all persons in the project and on the final product is clarified. This is done by identifying persons or groups which are relevant and their level of influence on the project.

Klaus Kolle and Morten Opprud, are the project coordinators/managers, they
have decision power over the final product and are directly involved with the development. As academic project, they are the ones that have to be satisfied with the final product. As project managers they guide the developers trough all the phases of the development process.\\

Jan Nielsen is the customer, the primary user of the system so he has the decision power over the final product and is enrol in all the development and design process. \\

Rene A. S. Josefsen is our web-interface customer, has no decision power in the overall system, but is direct involve in the design of the system interface.\\

In a production project, Jan and Rene satisfaction as clients, would be very important. In this project their feedback is used as requirements for the final product.\\ 

High School Students have no decision power over the final interface since they are the secondary users of the system. They will be one of the final users to test the system.\\

Jens Mortensen is the component supplier, is not directly involved in the project and has no decision power over the final product.\\

Per Lysgaard is not directly involved in the development of the system, but has the final decision of the budget for the system.\\

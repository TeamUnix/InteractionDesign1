A participatory design is most useful when developing a interface for only one user, since this user desires and toughs will be complete different from others. This method decreases the time of design, since the developers don't have to develop several prototypes until it meets the user needs. Instead the user is a co-designer, integrated as a developer and asked to design him self the layout/interface that is going to be needed. \p
Usability tests are the an useful and powerful tool in interaction design. A must in all the projects that involves an user or a group. This gives a great feedback on what is not that intuitive as expected. Different types of user knowledges have to be selected to have the most reliable feedback, keeping always in mind the target group or user that is going to interact with the system.\p
Before this introduction course to Interaction Design, our team was a little sceptic about it. The first thought was that it would be time consuming and would slow down the development of our system, without giving any useful feedback.\p
By doing the exercises proposed in the course, interaction design can be a great tool on user focus development, since it eliminates the faults and misunderstandings between what was understood as user needs, and what really was needed.\p
Interaction design was very useful to the project in this early phase. At first the development of a high fidelity prototype of the hub physical interface was performed, this would be easier to get the acceptance from the user, however this was not the case. As explained earlier, a participatory design session where scheduled, and for our experience, it can be very hard to define the needs and sessions with the user are can be very useful to define the exact needs.\p
The entire design process has been useful, it was possible to develop a static web interface for the hub, which tests have shown improvements to me made and with the help of a participatory design a layout of the physical interface with the exact user needs was created for further development.\p

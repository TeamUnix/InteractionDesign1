\section{Task Description}\textit{Theis.}\\
As developing the hub as the central part of the overall system, all the modules is connected to the hub. The hub then has to react when different events occurs in the system. That could be when a device starts producing energy, then the hub have to find out what to do with the extra energy. What if a consuming module starts consuming energy, or starts consuming more energy in short time. Our task is to develop a box that controls all the modules and react on that kind of events. Because of the fact that all modules is connected to the hub, then most of the interaction in this system is machine to machine communication. The human to machine interaction in the system is, on the hub and on a web page. The hub interaction is only for the owner, where the web page is for every one, which gives some additional requirements for the user interface. Is should be possible to see the status of the hub, the modules and to see how mush energy is producing and consuming.

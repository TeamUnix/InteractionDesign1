\section{Task Description}\textit{Theis.}\\
The goal of the PRO3 project is to develop an energy hub, to supply energy to consumer devices, like a vacuum cleaner or a oven, by harvesting energy from various renewable energy sources. The energy hub has a web interface where you can configure the different modules, and set up a fuelling profile, if you need instant power the hub will made you use the grid, or else it will just use the green energy modules. The hub will store energy if it is not used, this will be done in compressed air and on a battery.
